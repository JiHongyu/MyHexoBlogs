## Physical Review Letters

Physical Review Letters (PRL) is the premier APS journal for current research, providing rapid publication of short reports of important fundamental research in all fields of physics. PRL provides its diverse readership with weekly coverage of major advances in physics and cross-disciplinary developments.

## Physical Review X

Physical Review X (PRX) is an online-only, fully open access, peer-reviewed journal that aims to publish, as timely as possible, exceptional original research papers from all areas of pure, applied, and interdisciplinary physics.

## Reviews of Modern Physics

Reviews of Modern Physics (RMP) brings the broad fundamental physics literature in established topical areas together and places it within the context of current trends in research and applications. Its in-depth review articles and shorter Colloquia serve students, engineers, and physics researchers in a range of fields.

## Physical Review A

> covering atomic, molecular, and optical physics and quantum information
>
> 涉及原子、分子和光学物理学和量子信息

Physical Review A (PRA) provides a dependable resource of worldwide developments in the rapidly evolving area of atomic, molecular, and optical physics, as well as quantum information.

## Physical Review B

> covering condensed matter and materials physics
>
> 涉及凝聚态物理和物质物理

Physical Review B (PRB) is the largest and most comprehensive international journal specializing in condensed matter and materials physics phenomena.

## Physical Review C

> covering nuclear physics
>
> 核物理方向

Physical Review C (PRC) publishes leading research in all areas of experimental and theoretical nuclear physics.

## Physical Review D

> covering particles, fields, gravitation, and cosmology
>
> 涉及粒子、场、引力以及宇宙学

Physical Review D (PRD) publishes leading research in elementary particle physics, field theory, gravitation, and cosmology.

## Physical Review E

> covering statistical, nonlinear, biological, and soft matter physics
>
> 涉及统计、非线性、生物以及软物理问题

Physical Review E (PRE), broad and interdisciplinary in scope, focuses on collective phenomena of many-body systems, with statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics as the central themes of the journal.
